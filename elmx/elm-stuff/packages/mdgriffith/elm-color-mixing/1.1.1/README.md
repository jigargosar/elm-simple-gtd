# Elm Color Mixing

Functions to mix color.

Use the [Elm Core Color type](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/2.1.0/Color) to create your colors and this library to mix them.

This library is modeled off of the [LESSCSS color functions](http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations). See their documentation for general descriptions of each color operation.
