## Generic helpers and custom operators that I use across other projects

- `Toolkit.Helpers` contains generic helper functions for type conversion, error
handling, and working with lists, tuples, and functions

- `Toolkit.Operators` contains a set of custom infix operators for maintaining a
consistent, unidirectional coding style when working with lists, `Maybe` and
`Result` values, and functions that take multiple arguments
