Open Contributor Agreement
This Open Contributor Agreement (“OCA”) applies to any contribution that you
make to any product or project managed by us (the “project”), and sets out the
intellectual property rights you grant to us in the contributed materials. The
terms “us” and “we” shall mean the original copyright holder or holders. The
term “you” shall mean the person or entity making a contribution. If you do not
agree to be bound by these terms, do not contribute to the project. Any
contribution is considered acceptance of the terms and conditions below. Read
this agreement carefully before contributing. These terms and conditions
constitute a binding legal agreement.

1.  The term 'contribution' or ‘contributed materials’ means any source code,
    object code, patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual,
    documentation, or any other material posted or submitted by you to the
    project.

2.  With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and
    registrations, in your contribution:

    •   you hereby assign to us joint ownership, and to the extent that such
        assignment is or becomes invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, you
        hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide,
        no-charge, royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights
        under those copyrights. This includes, at our option, the right to
        sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels
        of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements;
    •   you agree that each of us can do all things in relation to your
        contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and if one of us
        makes a derivative work of your contribution, the one who makes the
        derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that
        derivative work;
    •   you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your
        contribution against us, our licensees or transferees;
    •   you agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and
        exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and
    •   you agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the
        consent of, pay or render an accounting to the other for any use or
        distribution of your contribution.

3.  With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without
    payment to any third party, you hereby grant to us a perpetual,
    irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to:

    •   make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
        transfer your contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination
        with or included in any product, work or materials arising out of the
        project to which your contribution was submitted, and
    •   at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties through
        multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

4.  Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in your
    contribution. The rights that you grant to us under these terms are
    effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to us, even if
    your submission took place before the date you agreed to these terms. Any
    contribution we make available under any license will also be made
    available under a suitable FSF (Free Software Foundation) or OSI
    (Open Source Initiative) approved license.

5.  You covenant, represent, warrant and agree that:

    •   each contribution that you submit is and shall be an original work of
        authorship and you can legally grant the rights set out in this OCA;
    •   to the best of your knowledge, each contribution will not violate any
        third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual
        property rights; and
    •   each contribution shall be in compliance with U.S. export control laws
        and other applicable export and import laws.
    •   You agree to notify us if you become aware of any circumstance which
        would make any of the foregoing representations inaccurate in any
        respect.
    •   We may publicly disclose your participation in the project, including
        the fact that you have agreed the OCA.
