(ideally notifications should be updated on todo change firebase function, so that we don't have to manage notification persistence to firebase manually. also notification data, if any will be up to date in firebase.

  * we had to centralize update of todo, and model had to return cmds. Not clean but will work for now.
  * in future we will move this work in firebase functions itself, this will also help us fix updating notifications scheduled when we were offline.
