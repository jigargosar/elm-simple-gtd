/**
 * Resolves requests first from an in-memory map of file contents, and if a
 * file isn't found there, defers to another url loader.
 *
 * Useful for the editor use case. An editor will have a number of files in open
 * buffers at any time. For these files, the editor's in-memory buffer is
 * canonical, so that their contents are read even when they have unsaved
 * changes. For all other files, we can load the files using another loader,
 * e.g. from disk.
 *
 * TODO(rictic): make this a mixin that mixes another loader.
