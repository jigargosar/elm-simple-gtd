<!--## Unreleased-->

## [2.0.2] - 2017-05-18

* Track methods on behaviors as such. They were being treated as properties.

## [2.0.1] - 2017-05-15

* Many errors were changed to warnings so they wouldn't stop builds from completing.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-05-15

* Stable release of the Polymer Analyzer.


#### Changes since the previous prerelease version:

* [BREAKING] `attributes`, `properties`, `methods`, and `events` are now Maps from the name to the value rather than arrays. This better models what's actually going on (you can't have two different properties with the same name in javascript) and it makes our inheritance modeling more efficient.
  * Note that the serialized output format `analysis.json` is not changed, it still uses arrays.
* Warning is now a class, not just an interface. It also now keeps track of the
  parsed document that it came from. This fixes a race condition and API wart
  where to print a warning you needed to load the source of the document
  that was seen when the warning was generated.
  * Also, thanks to using the ParsedDocument interface, printing a warning is
    now O(size of underlined text) rather than O(size of document).

## [2.0.0-alpha.42] - 2017-05-09

* [minor breaking change] The paths in `@demo` annotations are no longer resolved.
* Added `MultiUrlLoader` and `PrefixedUrlLoader` to support analysis of more complicated project layouts.

## [2.0.0-alpha.41] - 2017-05-08

* [BREAKING] The `ElementLike` interface in `AnalysisFormat` changed its `demos` property from `string[]` to `Demo[]`, to include more information from `@demo` annotations in Jsdocs.
* [minor breaking change] Simplify rules for infering privacy. Now all features: classes, elements, properties, methods, etc have one set of rules for inferring privacy. Explicit js doc annotations are respected, otherwise `__foo` and `foo_` are private, `_foo` is protected, and `foo` is public.
* Fixed issue where jsdocs syntax in HTML comments was not parsed for polymer elements.

## [2.0.0-alpha.40] - 2017-04-28

* Added support for new JSDoc tags: @customElement, @polymer, @mixinFunction, @appliesMixin

## [2.0.0-alpha.39] - 2017-04-26

* Add a Class feature kind for describing all kinds of classes. This is a superclass of the existing elements and mixins.
* Mix mixins into mixins. A PolymerElementMixin now has all of the members it inherits other mixins it mixes.
* Improved our modeling of inheritance:
  * overriding inherited members now works correctly
  * overriding a private member produces a Warning
* Documented many fields as being readonly/immutable. This isn't complete, in fact all features and scanned features should be treated as immutable once they're created and initialized.
* Treat behaviors more like mixins, and treat using behaviors more like inheriting from mixins. This means that a Behavior object knows about all of the properties, methods, etc that it has inherited from other Behaviors that it builds upon.
* Emit more warnings when recognizing mixins, elements, and classes.

## [2.0.0-alpha.38] - 2017-04-13

* [minor breaking change] Revert of a change from alpha.37. The experimental `_fork` method on Analyzer returns an Analyzer again, not a Promise of an Analyzer.

## [2.0.0-alpha.37] - 2017-04-12

* [BREAKING] Analyzer.analyze() now must be passed an array of urls instead of a single url and it returns an Analysis. Use Analysis.getDocument(url) to get a Document from an Analysis.
* [BREAKING] The `getByKind`, `getById`, `getOnlyAtId`, and `listFeatures` methods on Document and Package have been replaced with a single method: `getFeatures`. It has all of the functionality of the individual methods, just packaged as a single simple query interface.
* [BREAKING] Dropped support for node v4, added support for node v8. See our [node version support policy](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/node-support) for details.
* Added `canLoad` method to `Analyzer`.
* Handle undefined source ranges more gracefully in WarningPrinter.
* [polymer] Negative number literals are allowed in databindings.

## [2.0.0-alpha.36] - 2017-04-07

* [BREAKING] Analyzer.analyze no longer takes the file's current contents as a second argument. This functionality was broken into two pieces, `filesChanged`, and `InMemoryOverlayLoader`.
  * Added a `filesChanged` method to Analyzer letting it know when a file needs to be reloaded.
  * Added an `InMemoryOverlayLoader` UrlLoader, for cases like a text editor where you'd like to use an in memory source of truth for a subset of files.
* The warning printer displays the squiggle underline in the correct place on lines indented by tabs.
* Extract className from the form `var className = Polymer({...})`
* Do a better job of matching comments up with Polymer 2 style element declarations.

## [2.0.0-alpha.35] - 2017-04-05

* [minor breaking change] By default queries for features and warnings now traverse lazy imports. Added a query option to limit results only to those reachable by normal (eager) imports.
* `generateAnalysis()` now includes PolymerBehavior information in `metadata.polymer.behaviors` collection.
* Jsdoc `@demo` annotations are now added to `demos` collection for `Element`, `ElementMixin`, `PolymerElement` and `Behavior`.
* Types and descriptions are now extracted from method @param and @returns jsdoc annotations.
* Fixed caching issue such that Documents would not always have information from the latest versions of their dependencies.

## [2.0.0-alpha.34] - 2017-03-20

* All Documents, ParsedDocuments, and ScannedDocuments now have correct SourceRanges. This also fixes a bug whereby `getByKind('document')` would fail to filter out package-external Documents.
* Fix an issue where package-external features could be included in queries that dot not ask for them. Specifically we were filtering based on the text in files  like `../paper-button/paper-button.html` rather than the path to the file on disk like `bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html` when determining externality.
* Treat a directory named `build` as external, same as we do ones named `bower_components.*` or `node_modules.*`

## [2.0.0-alpha.33] - 2017-03-14

* Populate `astNode` on `PolymerElementMixin`.

## [2.0.0-alpha.32] - 2017-03-13

* Added options argument for Analyzer's experimental `_fork` method, supporting individual property overrides.
* Parse observers and computed functions in Polymer declarations. Warn on parse errors, or using the wrong syntax (e.g. function calls in `observer`, not a function call in `computed`).
* Correctly scan the `customElements.define(MyClass.is, MyClass)` pattern.

## [2.0.0-alpha.31] - 2017-03-07

* Clean up method descriptions

## [2.0.0-alpha.30] - 2017-03-03

* Fix typo in package.json.

## [2.0.0-alpha.29] - 2017-03-03

* Added a `_fork` method to Analyzer.
* Support for method detection on polymer elements and mixins via the new `methods` property.
* Support for function analysis (namespaced functions only for now, via the `@memberof` jsdoc tag).
* Track privacy on elements, mixins, properties, methods, and functions on namespaces.
  * replaced `private: boolean` with `privacy: 'public' | 'private' | 'protected'`
  * respects `@public` `@private` and `@protected` in jsdoc
  * considers one leading underscore to be protected, and two to be private
  * one trailing underscore is private (closure style)
* Track inheritance source for mixin and element members.
* Exported all public api through the package's `main` file, so that all public api can be accessed directly off of the object returned by `require('polymer-analyzer')` without the need to add imports into `polymer-analyzer/lib/whatever`.
* Track mixins on mixins and emit them in the Analysis. We don't mix properties into mixins yet.

## [2.0.0-alpha.28] - 2017-02-24

  from a `<base href="...">` tag, when present.

## [2.0.0-alpha.23] - 2017-02-10

### Added

* [BREAKING] All methods on Document no longer return results from dependencies, but do return results from inline documents. Added a queryOptions param to all query methods to specify getting results from dependencies.
* [BREAKING] All methods on both Document and Package no longer return results from external code. Must specify `externalPackages: true` to get features from code outside the current package.

### Fixed

* Notice references to elements within `<template>` tags.

## [2.0.0-alpha.22] - 2017-01-13

### Fixed
* Bump JS parser up to parse ES2017 (ES8).

### Fixed
* [Polymer] A number of fixes around warnings when resolving behaviors
  * Warn, don't throw when a behavior is declared twice.
